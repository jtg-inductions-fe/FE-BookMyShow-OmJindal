## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 24+. You can download and install it from nodejs.org.
- **npm**: Node.js package manager, which comes bundled with Node.js.

### Installing

To set up the project on your local environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, you need to clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. **nvm (Node Version Manager)**: If the required Node version 24+ is already installed and active, you can skip this step else you can use nvm (Node Version Manager). Here's how to use it:
   - **Switch Node Version**: If the required Node version is already installed, run:

   ```bash
   nvm use
   ```

   - **Install Node Version**: If the required Node version isn’t installed, you can install it by running:

   ```bash
   nvm install
   ```

   > **_Tip:_** If you don't have nvm installed, you can install it by following the instructions on [nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

   Alternatively, you can update Node.js directly by downloading the latest version from the official website: nodejs.org.

3. **Install the necessary dependencies using npm**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will typically be available at http://localhost:3000, but check the terminal output for the exact URL.

   > **_NOTE:_** : If you want to change the server's port number, you can do so by creating a **.env file** at the root level of the project and update the PORT field (check **.env.template** for reference)

   ```env
   PORT=<New Port>
   ```

5. **Format the Code**

   ```bash
   npm run prettier:fix
   ```

6. **Lint the Code**

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

7. **To Fix Lint errors**

   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   ```

8. **Build the Project**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command will generate the optimized production build in the dist directory.

9. **Preview the build**

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

10. **Setup Husky (If pre-commit hooks are not working)**

    ```bash
    npx husky init
    ```
